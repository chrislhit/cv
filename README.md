### **Job Briefing Overview**

I am a seasoned IT Project Manager with over two decades of experience leading complex IT initiatives and aligning technology solutions with evolving business objectives. I consistently deliver projects on time, within budget, and to high quality standards by strategically leveraging resources and team strengths.

My approach blends strategic planning with hands-on execution. I excel in defining scopes, structuring tasks, coordinating cross-functional deliverables, and proactively managing risks. I ensure that outcomes meet both technical and functional expectations.

I maintain strong stakeholder engagement through regular participation in working groups and progress reviews, ensuring clear communication across business units, IT teams, and leadership. This collaboration helps drive alignment and transparency throughout the project lifecycle.

With expertise in PM2, PRINCE2, and PMI methodologies, I apply structured practices for planning, change control, and reporting. I use tools like MS Project, Jira, and Confluence to manage timelines, allocate resources, and track KPIs—often developing custom solutions for better reporting and oversight.

I work closely with senior stakeholders to refine estimates, adjust priorities, and adapt to evolving requirements without compromising project stability. I am committed to quality throughout each phase, actively managing risks and ensuring timely resolution of issues.

My technical background, particularly with relational databases, allows me to contribute meaningfully to both technical and business discussions. I regularly deliver clear, tailored presentations to a variety of audiences and excel at translating complex topics into actionable insights.
